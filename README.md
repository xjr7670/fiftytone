A little game to help for remember Japanese Hiragana, Katakana, Hiragana with Diacritical Marks, and Transcribing Contracted Sounds.

Just enter the character into the text box then push down the "ENTER" button on your keyboard, if the character you entered matches any characters above it (which is floating from left to right), the floating one will disappear and a new one will replace it and start floating from the left edge.
